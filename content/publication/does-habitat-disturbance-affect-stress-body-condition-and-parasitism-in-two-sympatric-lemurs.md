  Understanding how animals react to human-induced changes in their environment
  is a key question in conservation biology. Owing to their potential
  correlation with fitness, several physiological parameters are commonly used
  to assess the effect of habitat disturbance on animals’ general health status.
  Here, we studied how two lemur species, the fat-tailed dwarf lemur
  (Cheirogaleus medius) and the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), respond
  to changing environmental conditions by comparing their stress levels
  (measured as hair cortisol concentration), parasitism and general body
  condition across four habitats ordered along a gradient of human disturbance
  at Kirindy Forest, Western Madagascar. These two species previously revealed
  contrasting responses to human disturbance; whereas M. murinus is known as a
  resilient species, C. medius is rarely encountered in highly disturbed
  habitats. However, neither hair cortisol concentrations nor parasitism
  patterns (prevalence, parasite species richness and rate of multiple
  infections) and body condition varied across the gradient of anthropogenic
  disturbance. Our results indicate that the effect of anthropogenic activities
  at Kirindy Forest is not reflected in the general health status of both
  species, which may have developed a range of behavioural adaptations to deal
  with suboptimal conditions. Nonetheless, a difference in relative density
  among sites suggests that the carrying capacity of disturbed habitat is lower,
  and both species respond differently to environmental changes, with C. medius
  being more negatively affected. Thus, even for behaviourally flexible species,
  extended habitat deterioration could hamper long-term viability of
  populations.
