  Hair cortisol concentrations (hairF) are considered to be relatively robust to
  various confounding influences. However, a potentially important covariate
  factor that has received little attention in this context is hair exposure to
  ultraviolet/sunlight radiation. We conducted a detailed experimental
  investigation to examine the effects of light exposure on hair cortisol. In
  study I, a hydrocortisone-containing solution was subjected to short-term
  artificial light irradiation for 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, or 30min to evaluate the
  stability of cortisol molecules due to radiant energy. In study II, hair
  samples (N=12) were subjected to single short-term artificial light
  irradiation for 0, 1, or 5h to examine light-induced effects in the hair
  matrix. In study III, hair samples (N=25) were subjected to long-term
  naturalistic sunlight radiation over a period of two months (during summer)
  with daily exposure times of 0, 1, 3, or 6h, respectively. Besides cortisol,
  studies II & III also examined concentrations of cortisone (hairE),
  dehydroepiandrosterone (hairDHEA) and progesterone (hairP) in hair, quantified
  using LC-MS/MS technology. Results across the three studies consistently
  revealed effects of light irradiation on hair steroid concentrations: Longer
  light exposure resulted in a decrease of dissolved hydrocortisone (study I) as
  well as of hairF and hairE (studies II and III). Conversely, hairDHEA and
  hairP increased with longer natural sunlight exposure times (study III), while
  this effect was not observed for short-term artificial light irradiation
  (study II). Combined, our findings imply sunlight exposure as a potential
  confound in hair steroid research. Given the experimental character of this
  investigation, the magnitude of this effect under real-life testing conditions
  is difficult to estimate. To support future investigation into this, we
  designed a 'sunlight-exposure' questionnaire to share with the research
  community. The assessment and statistical accounting for sunlight
  exposure-related effects in future hair steroid research (using this or a
  similar questionnaire) may help to reduce the potential influence of this
  unwanted error source and could thus lead to more valid and reliable results.
  In addition, our data strongly suggest that hair samples for steroid analyses
  need to be stored in a dark environment.
